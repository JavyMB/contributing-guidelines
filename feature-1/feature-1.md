# Feature 1

Example of feature branch 
```
git checkout -b feat/Feature-name-1 develop 
```
Each team can create their own naming guideline 

`feature/nameCamelCase`

`feat/Name-Of-Feature`

`feature_name_of`

I specially recomend using "feat/*" just because is readable and short.

Avoid: 

`f/*`

`cool_naming-without-format-and-long`

`UPPER_CASE-S&DI*` 

Stay in the "a-z,0-9" range, try to avoid as much as possible symbols (This is not a rule, just a recomendation).
